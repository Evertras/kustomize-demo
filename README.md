Quick demo playing with Kustomize.

Referenced heavily from https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kustomize/blob/master/examples/helloWorld/kustomization.yaml

## The demo app

We use [hello](https://github.com/monopole/hello) as a demo application here.
It allows us to change some arbitrary configuration for demonstration purposes.
